“I know you don’t desire a protector. But if you’re with me, you’re receiving one,” he said, his voice developing rough. “I’m never likely to be that dude who remaining you vulnerable once again. I can’t offer much these days, but I can assurance you that. I’ve got your again, Livvy. I could keep you safe.”

Just a few days into 2018 and I’ve currently found a new favorite! I remember staying intrigued by the storyline of this book from the very first time I reading its blurb and I’m so glad I made a decision to browse it because Roni Loren was a new-to-me author and I treasured her posting style and currently can’t wait to read her next book!

This book checked off a lot of my boxes. The hero and heroine experienced once been senior high school sweethearts who’d placed their relationship a top secret. His family was rich and judgmental and she was the daughter of their gardener, even though neither of them cared whatsoever bit about what kind of families they came from, these were scared of what would happen if his father discovered that his boy was falling in love with a gal from the wrong part of the tracks.

But any ideas they would have made to take their relationship in to the open were brutally cut brief when their lives were torn aside by tragic university shooting on the prom night.

Greater than a decade following this horrific event, they were reunited and all of the sudden forced to handle everything they’d left out, including the strength of the feelings they nonetheless had for the other person - emotions that had never really faded. And with this reunion came up a second likelihood at the life span and love that were stolen from their website so many years ago.

He’d wanted to grab her. He’d wanted to fix points. Apologize. Do something to consider that haunted watch out of her eye. Do something showing her how goddamned sorry he was.

This story was equal parts sexy, swoony, emotional, and healing! I genuinely looked after these characters, I thought the romance and adored how strongly I could feel that this couple genuinely belonged together

“Everything that we were before that nights got erased.” She snapped her fingers before his face. “Gone. Exactly like that.”
“Certainly not everything, Liv,” he explained softly, lifting his side like he would reach for her but lowering it to his side once again. “They can’t have everything.”

As with any story that handles a school shooting, this tale had an extremely strong emotional undercurrent. Both event and the remembrances had left deep scars on the survivors and you could sense that heaviness from the start of the book. Nevertheless, what actually made me merely ‘know’ that book was successful was that moment when the hero and heroine earliest saw each other after all the years of separation. There is this heightened good sense of soreness, longing, desire all blended in jointly in a manner that made my center race. When a reserve gives me those kind of spine tingles from the start, it almost always actually is a favorite.

Her words take off, her tone of voice dying an instant death, just as Finn got closer plus some of the studio lighting caught him within their glare. The man approaching was nothing like the boy she’d known. The bulky football muscle tissue had streamlined right into a harder, leaner bundle. The month deal with was now dusted with scruff, and the appearance in his deep-green eye support no trace of boyish innocence. One thousand stuff were in those eyes.

Following the shooting, they’d each coped in similar ways - throwing themselves wholeheartedly to their careers. Liv experienced turn into something of a workaholic while Finn experienced left his senior high school football times behind and gone into professional protector method by learning to be a cop. However, his latest objective was an undercover operation that experienced immersed him in a brutal environment he was still attempting to shake from his life when he was reunited with Liv.

“I’m back found in the city that thinks I’m a good hero when I wasn’t, speaking with some reporter about stuff I hope I could forget, and standing here with the lady I nearly got killed - and I even so don’t know what to say to her.”

To balance out the heaviness of their earlier, there was lots of fun, flirty banter that typically manufactured me smile for pages on end. And for anybody who love a little spice and steam in your romance, I believe you’ll be happy with this reserve. While I highly appreciated the original slow burn of this romance, I as well loved that heat was dialed completely up at all of the right times to really convey a well-written hot romance with a lighter part as well.

She choke-laughed and pressed her give her mouth.
“I mean, really? I slide up and claim something I shouldn’t, and you head out with ‘erect’ within the next sentence?” he teased. “Approach to create it weird.”
“Hey, ‘erect’ is a good perfectly proper phrase. I can’t make it if your brain was in the gutter.”
“I’ve been celibate for two years. Assume it’s generally there. I’ve create shop and built just a little gutter village. We’re going to elect a mayor.”

The story is told from both Liv and Finn’s POVs however in third person. The story takes place in present day and I found the timeline very simple to follow. Also, the story isn't only about the hero and heroine, but also in regards to a close band of the heroine’s friends who got bonded following the shooting and placed touch through the years.

This book may be the first standalone in some standalones. The next one is available for preorder and it’s about another of the close friends and I’m guessing there’ll be more coming about the rest of the friends as well. I like all of the people and am definitely looking forward to seeing them all receive the happily ever before afters they deserve.

Overall, I’d definitely say that I loved this book and really enjoyed the reading. There have been a few parts occasionally that felt just a little toned or were longer than necessary. But the majority of the e book was beautiful, hot, and filled with feels.

“You protected me.”
He shrugged, nonetheless keeping your hands on her other side. “That’s my job.”
She pinned him with a look. “No, it’s certainly not. You’re not working at this time. I wouldn’t expect or prefer you to have a bullet for me personally.”
… “I know you don’t need a protector. But if you’re with me, you’re obtaining one,” he explained, his voice coming out rough. “I’m never likely to be that man who remaining you vulnerable once again. I can’t offer substantially these days, but I can guarantee you that. I’ve acquired your back again, Livvy. I could keep you safe.”

I’m so glad that I reading this book! It had been a well-written, well-well-balanced romance and Roni Loren can be new favorite writer for me! If you’re searching for something not used to read, I’d absolutely recommend checking out this book!
