I didn’t recognize that The Wrath and the Dawn by Renee Ahdieh may be the first e book of a series therefore i was very confused when We was winding right down to the final pages and the story wasn’t wrapping up. Upon finishing the e book, and reading a very frustrating finish, I freaked out, shouting to my roommate about the irritating ending. Just what a cliffhanger of an ending it was and today I can’t wait to read another one. Ahdieh entirely hooked me and the sequel doesn’t turn out until May of 2016! Let the waiting begin…

I wasn’t sure about The Wrath and the Dawn at first. Do you read a e book and get hence sucked into the effortlessly constructed writing that you ignore you’re studying? This story wasn’t among those for me personally. BUT, and that’s a huge but, I really enjoyed the book in any case and was totally enthralled by the ongoing romance between Shahrzad and the boy king Khalid. A conflicting romantic relationship of hate and interest, honesty and secrets, it’s definitely intriguing.

This story starts with the marriage between Shahrzad and Khalid. A mystical young man, the king provides been marrying a fresh bride every day and has already established them each executed at dawn of the next morning. After a dear friend marries, and dies, at the control of the king, Shahrzad volunteers to marry him. Defying all odds she lives through the primary dawn and vows to get revenge on her behalf lost friend. The better she reaches Khalid, the considerably more conflicted her mission becomes…

Ahdieh’s debut novel is a great one particular, and with themes from Arabian Nights and Aladdin, there are factors of fantasy aswell.
