The Last Good Girl by Allison Leotta hits home. Nowadays the media is filled with reports of sexual assault on school campuses; Leotta has created a mystery novel that brings this matter to light through a gripping chase. I would like to point out that is the fifth book in the Anna Curtis series, nevertheless it’s the initially one I’ve found and it was easy to reading as a standalone.

Emily Shapiro, A good freshman at Tower University, is excited to visit her first college or university party. A get together filled with dancing, perhaps a little drinking, and boys. Bit of does she understand that the party won’t hold the happy thoughts she hopes for - instead she actually is drugged and raped. When Emily goes lacking, prosecutor Anna Curtis is named in.

Emily was last seen on video recording running from her accused rapist and the tale spirals from there. The book is informed from multiple perspectives. From Anna, from Emily’s video weblogs leading up to the time she went lacking, and from a freshman pledge in the fraternity where Emily was raped. They were seriously contrasting perspectives that provided the report some depth.

The Last Good Girl kept me hooked, as a result of the horrifying and terrible occurrences of sexual assaults on school campuses, and by the chase to find Emily. I absolutely recommend this book (warning: there’s some graphic content) and would go through another by Allison Leotta. I appreciate her ability to produce a gripping mystery novel that brings focus on such a serious issue - for that, I would like to thank her.
