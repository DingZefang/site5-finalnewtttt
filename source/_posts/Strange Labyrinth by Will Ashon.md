I just wasn’t at all sure about Strange Labyrinth when it turned up - it appeared as if a publication that didn’t quite really know what it was said to be about - but once started We was hooked, enchanted even. It tells the storyline of Epping Forest, the six thousand acres on the advantage of London preserved for the country in 1878, but that description hardly scrapes the surface of this intensely personal, magpie’s jewel box of a reserve which introduces its viewers to a various and colourful cast of characters who’ve inhabited this patch of ancient woodland.

Like so lots of the middle-aged and privileged, Will Ashon finds himself in something of an emergency. He’s posted two novels which have passed mainly unnoticed, enjoyed a profession as a music journalist and walked from the prize-earning record label he setup fifteen years back. He adores his wife and kids but there’s something he can’t quite set his finger on. Dante’s ‘dark forest’ involves head as he fills his days and nights wandering around Epping Forest, engaging in desultory research in to the background of the woods and those who’ve resided there while informing his family and friends he’s writing a book. Ultimately he stops ‘pretending’ and gets trapped in. What he discovers is both extraordinary and amusing. From sculptor Jacob Epstein and his endlessly sufferer wife who finds methods to tolerate his constant infidelities to Classic Mick, a legendary protestor with an elaborately embroidered former, from Ken Campbell, the actor dubbed by Mike Leigh ’the outsider’s outsider’ to Penny Rimbaud, the polymath most widely known as founder member of that archetypal anarcho-punk band Crass, Epping Forest appears to have already been a magnet for eccentric characters. Ashon walks the woodland paths, spotting strangely graffitied trees, assessing them for over night potential and nervously staying away from pups while pondering on the fear of authority that appears to be the main of his individual malaise.

Impossible not to utilize the phrase mid-life crisis when discussing this book, a exhausted, overused, sitcom cliché which Ashon neatly avoids, but while it may have been the trigger it’s a tranquil theme which underpins his research rather than a hammer with which he beats his readers more than the head. Many of the denizens of Epping, both past and present, happen to be anti-authoritarian numbers to whom Ashon is definitely drawn but although his admiration can be distinct he determinedly steers himself away from hero-worship. It’s a splendidly erudite but engaging e book. Ashon is normally a self-deprecating and discursive information, often very funny: ‘phrases dribbled out onto my laptop with all the current force and self-assurance of a vintage man peeing right into a glass’; ‘I viewed two crows involved in a tussle which, as with drunks in a club, could’ve been dispute or courtship’. It ends with Ashon - after a good deal of anxious procrastination - climbing his favourite tree, determined  to invest a night out in the forest, in that case suffering from an epiphany. A touch too neat and tidy for a e book which begins using its author’s angst, it might seem, but it performs. A wonderfully idiosyncratic, somehow very British reserve which delighted me from learn to finish. And if you’d like to find out about another man’s tangle with mid-existence crisis and how he set about dealing with it you could pick up a replicate of Andy Miller’s interesting The Year of Reading Dangerously.
